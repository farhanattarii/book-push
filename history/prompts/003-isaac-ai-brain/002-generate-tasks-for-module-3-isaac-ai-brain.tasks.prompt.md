# Generate tasks for Module 3 Isaac AI Brain

## Prompt Text

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Text

Successfully generated tasks.md for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™). The tasks document includes:

- Phase 1: Setup tasks for project structure
- Phase 2: Foundational tasks for Isaac ecosystem concepts
- Phase 3: User Story 1 tasks for Isaac Sim environment setup
- Phase 4: User Story 2 tasks for Isaac ROS integration
- Phase 5: User Story 3 tasks for Nav2 humanoid navigation
- Phase 6: Polish and cross-cutting concerns

The tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. Each user story has independent test criteria and is organized for parallel execution where possible. The implementation strategy allows for MVP delivery with User Story 1 as the core functionality.

**Feature Branch**: `1-vla-robotics`
**Created**: 2025-12-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Target audience:
 AI and robotics students focusing on LLM integration

Focus:
 Convergence of LLMs and robotics for autonomous humanoid actions

Success criteria:
- Implement voice-to-action using OpenAI Whisper
- Use LLMs for cognitive planning to convert natural language commands into ROS 2 actions
- Demonstrate capstone project: autonomous humanoid executing tasks via voice commands
- Chapters include clear explanations and runnable examples
- All claims supported by official documentation"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Voice Command to Robot Action (Priority: P1)

As an AI and robotics student, I want to issue voice commands to a humanoid robot so that it performs the requested actions autonomously.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that demonstrates the VLA concept and provides immediate value to students learning about LLM-robotics integration.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by speaking a command to the system and observing the robot's response, delivering the core value proposition of the module.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student speaks a clear voice command to the system, **When** the system processes the command, **Then** the humanoid robot executes the corresponding action via ROS 2
2. **Given** a student speaks an ambiguous command, **When** the system cannot determine the action, **Then** the system requests clarification before proceeding

### User Story 2 - Cognitive Planning for Complex Tasks (Priority: P2)

As an AI and robotics student, I want the system to break down complex natural language commands into sequences of robot actions so that multi-step tasks can be executed.

**Why this priority**: This demonstrates the cognitive planning aspect of LLMs in robotics, which is essential for real-world applications.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by giving complex commands that require multiple sequential actions, verifying that the system plans and executes the sequence correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a complex voice command requiring multiple steps, **When** the system processes the command, **Then** the LLM generates an appropriate sequence of ROS 2 actions and executes them in order

---

### User Story 3 - Educational Content and Examples (Priority: P3)

As an AI and robotics student, I want to access clear explanations and runnable examples so that I can understand and implement VLA concepts effectively.

**Why this priority**: Educational content is essential for student learning and understanding of the concepts being demonstrated.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by reviewing the provided examples and verifying they run successfully with clear documentation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student accesses the educational materials, **When** they follow the examples, **Then** they can successfully run and modify the provided VLA implementations

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the audio input is noisy or unclear?
- How does the system handle commands that would result in unsafe robot actions?
- What occurs when the LLM cannot generate an appropriate ROS 2 action for a given command?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST integrate with OpenAI Whisper for speech-to-text conversion
- **FR-002**: System MUST use an LLM to interpret natural language commands and generate ROS 2 action sequences
- **FR-003**: System MUST execute generated ROS 2 actions on a humanoid robot (simulated or physical)
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide educational content with clear explanations and runnable examples
- **FR-005**: System MUST include a capstone project demonstrating the complete VLA pipeline
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle speech recognition errors gracefully by asking the user to repeat the command with suggestions to speak more clearly
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate generated actions against safety boundaries (range limits, speed limits, force limits) that actions must comply with to prevent unsafe robot behaviors

### Key Entities

- **Voice Command**: Natural language input from user that initiates the VLA process
- **Speech-to-Text Output**: Transcribed text from voice command processed by Whisper
- **Cognitive Plan**: Sequence of actions generated by LLM from interpreted command
- **ROS 2 Action**: Robot command formatted according to ROS 2 standards
- **Humanoid Robot**: Physical or simulated robot that executes the requested actions
- **Educational Module**: Content and examples that explain VLA concepts to students

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

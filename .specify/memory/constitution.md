# AI/Spec-Driven Book with Embedded RAG Chatbot Constitution

## Core Principles

### Spec-First Workflow
Spec-First workflow using Spec-Kit Plus: All development begins with comprehensive specifications that define requirements, interfaces, and acceptance criteria before any implementation work begins. This ensures alignment between stakeholders and reduces costly rework.

### Technical Accuracy from Official Sources
Technical accuracy from official sources: All content and code examples must be verified against official documentation and authoritative sources. No information should be based on assumptions or unofficial resources that could lead to inaccuracies.

### Clear, Developer-Focused Writing
Clear, developer-focused writing: All documentation and explanations must prioritize clarity and practical utility for developers. Content should be accessible, actionable, and focused on solving real-world problems with concrete examples.

### Reproducible Setup and Deployment
Reproducible setup and deployment: All development environments, build processes, and deployment procedures must be fully documented and reproducible. This ensures consistent experiences across all team members and environments.

### Quality Standards and Documentation
Runnable, well-documented code: All code examples must be functional, tested, and accompanied by clear documentation explaining purpose, usage, and expected outcomes. Code quality and maintainability are essential.

### No Hallucination Policy
No hallucinated responses: The RAG chatbot must be grounded only in book content or user-selected text. It must never generate responses based on fabricated or hallucinated information that is not present in the provided context.

## Technology Stack and Standards
Technology stack requirements and deployment policies: The book is written with Docusaurus and deployed on GitHub Pages. The RAG chatbot uses OpenAI Agents/ChatKit, FastAPI, Neon Postgres, and Qdrant Cloud. All components must follow modern best practices for security, performance, and maintainability.

## Development Workflow and Success Criteria
Development workflow, quality gates, and success metrics: GitHub-based source control is mandatory. All specifications must be implemented via Spec-Kit Plus. Success is measured by having a live book on GitHub Pages with a fully functional embedded RAG chatbot that meets all specified requirements.

## Governance
This constitution governs all aspects of the AI/Spec-Driven Book with Embedded RAG Chatbot project. All development activities, code reviews, and project decisions must comply with these principles. Amendments to this constitution require explicit approval and must be documented with clear justification.
